#Hi#

This is a [Markdown][1] live editor built using [WMD][2] and other open source tools. I use it to write entries for my [posterous][3] blog and other places where Markdown is needed.

##Usage##

When you press the *copy markdown* button you'll get the markdown markup wrapped in `markdown` and `p` tags, so you can send it as an email to post@posterous.com to create a new entry for your own blog.

> *if your browser supports HTML 5, this text will be stored locally*

###Adding images###

###Writting code ###

    #!javascript
    function hi(){
        alert('hi!');
    }
